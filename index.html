		<p>Uganda is endowed with numerous aquatic resources with aqua cultural potential, it has highly varied climatic and geographic regions, covering apart the largest portion of the fresh water in the world <strong>Lake Victoria</strong> and several rivers, swamps and other wetlands all of which supports an abundance of native aquatic species and of which many can sustainably contribute to the construction of pond or cleared like the one of Nabisojjo for fish production.</p>

			<p>Nakaseke District is an agricultural district with an estimated population of <strong>419,700 People (2009)</strong> and the majority are peasants. The district owns one minor lake/natural water bodies <u>Nabisojjo</u>.<br/>
			Supply of fish and fish products are limited to the community for consumption, shortage and demand for fish and animal protein is at an increasing rate yet about 80% of the population is living in poor and rural conditions and cannot afford fish due to high prices and export demand.<br/>
			With the government efforts to fight poverty, <strong>Mr. Sowedi Mukubira</strong> the proprietor of the farm. 4 illiteracy, hunger, malnutrition at household levels, fish farming is one of the activities which will bridge the gaps in nutrition and food security. In it's plan for modernization of Agriculture, New policies about a liberalization of the economy, promotion of private investments, and increasing the export base all equipped with knowledge and skills in modern fish farming technology to change from subsistence to commercial farming and to stop dependence on natural water bodies.</p>
				<p>The Proprietor, Sowedi Mukubira has a long fishing exposure right from his childhood. His grandfather, his father and then himself have experience in traditional fish industry of over Forty <strong>(40)</strong> years and this continues to be a family trade. His son is soon graduating with <strong>BSC</strong> in Fisheries from Makerere University.</p>

		<p>The company is thereof seeking the government and stakeholders in the fish industry to introduce this concept of research to those who will need it or to apply. We think this will need the known extension workers and trainers in the industry to acquire the found method to pass it to farmers. <br>
		With the government’s efforts to fight poverty, illiteracy, hunger, malnutrition at household levels, fish farming is one of the activities which will bridge the gaps in nutrition and food security. 
		In the government Development sector investment plan (DSIP) policies about a liberalized economy and promotion of private investments, and increasing the export base all equipped with knowledge.
		The company has opted to invest into skills for modern fish farming technology to change from substantial fish farming into commercial fish farming and to stop dependence on natural water bodies but to also to develop inland water resources available this includes Swamps, Rivers, Minor Lakes and Construction of Ponds along their shores into fish production.</p>

	<p>Due to the water weeds and plants found on the lake, according to the research carried out it was found that the water was accommodating the small indigenous fish (locally known as Buyamba and Nkejje and also mud fish (Mamba) because these species requires less oxygen to live. The company Directors had a dream and interest to do commercial fish farming for last ten years however knowledge, funds and a better place for the venture were the limit. First and foremost the company had to invest in one of its directors to acquire knowledge and technology for the venture, he was sent for a course in fish technology and management/ aquaculture in which he acquired a diploma in 2008 from Entebbe fisheries institute and later went to MUK for Bsc in Fisheries where is now in his last year. He is now studying in Telaviv-Israel.</p>

<!--the project's objectives-->
<div class="object">
	<h3 class="head" id="objective">the project's objectives</h3>

		<p>The company will contribute to increase in fish production, bio-diversity conservation, peoples’ livelihood, food security and nutrition, income generation, and employment to the community.<br/>
		To bring a new era in the fish industry to both the communities that fish can be reared in INLAND waters at commercial basis and also the government to start thinking to locate foreign investors to go deep in villages than fighting for the only known waters by communities and politician which have led to the government failure to fulfill its program /policy to increasing fish production in the country.</p>

			<h4 class="semi">specific objectives</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>To increase aquaculture fish farm production for local and export market.</li>
					<li>To conserve aquaculture bio-diversity to enhance nature resources utilization for sustainable development.</li>
					<li>To create self employment opportunities to support livelihood to local community.</li>
					<li>To resurrect the government policy to increase fish production in the two Districts Luwero & Nakaseke of which the company has come with the solution to correct the cause.</li>
					<li>To raise high quality and big quantity of fingerings of likely naturally prepared but domesticated which will enable the community and the government to restock their ponds and minor lakes.</li>
				</ul> 

			<h3 class="head">approaches and methodology</h3>
			<p>Innovative approaches and methods will be used to implement the project technology e.g. cage, ponds, ecotourism etc.</p>

		<h5 class="semi">Cage fish farming</h5>
		<p>By use of nets, several compartments will be installed within the lake. Here fish will be easily farmed with close monitoring.<br>
		This approach will take into account the indigenous knowledge and capacity building for development of Aquaculture at Local levels through farmer to farmer extension approach and training the younger generation in the Nakaseke District and the country about fish farming.<br/>
		<strong><em>Cages installed on the lake and ponds will be constructed on the shores of the lake</em></strong></p>

	<h3 class="head">project partners and their roles</h3>
	
<ul class="partners">
	<li><h5 class="headpartn">Development partners</h5> <br>(The government and donors) will play a leading role in providing funds to the project and participate in the monitoring and evaluation of project activities.</li><br>

	<li><h5 class="headpartn">Proprietor</h5><br>Will implement the project provide labor, Land, mobilization of community, participatory planning and engage in agricultural production among others.</li><br>

	<li><h5 class="headpartn">Nakaseke production department NAADS, FISHERIES</h5><br>Will participate in monitoring and also provide guidelines on policy and gender issues</li><br>

	<li><h5 class="headpartn">The research institution </h5><br>The group leaders will be linked and work in consultation with the institution for information sharing and updating technology.</li><br>

	<li><h5 class="headpartn">The project/company</h5><br>Will be responsible to proved interested farmers with fingerlings with a reasonable size between 50-80grams on credit and feeds related to requirement.</li><br>

	<li><h5 class="headpartn">The company</h5><br>Will be responsible to market the products and updating stake holders with information concerning the venture.</li>
</ul>

	<h3 class="head">technology under consideration</h3>
	<p>Semi extensive fish farming appropriate artificial propagation of <em>clarias gariepinus</em> cat fish and Tilapia are advantageous over natural and semi-natural fry production / breeding. It has been projected for commercial fry production and its advantage is that production, planning for quality, quantity and reliable fry is guaranteed and farmers will be supplied with fingerling which will be nursed by the project to at least with a body weight of 50-80grams of which in the project’s research most farmers their failure was found that they were supplied with fry 0.5grm-1grm which led them to straggle much to feed them regarding to feeds provided to them had been finished.</p>

		<p>According to their explanation (farmers) they were trained and advised to prepare feeds at their own farms but not given when and at what size of the fish should be fed on. The self processed feeds led to poor growth of the fry supplied to farmers even some sought they were supplied with poor quality where as it was from Kajansi station.<br>
		The company has come to save the situation by supplying the farmers with fingerlings of the size which survive and even accept to feed on farmer’s self processed feeds however it may cause delay in terms of harvest but the farm can’t fail to benefit from a cycle.</p>

			<p>Here farmers will be given fingerling worth his/her stocking capacity of the pond and they will not be advice to inter crop with catfish as have been recommended previously to control the population in the pond, the company through its coordinators as the stocked fish begin to breed the company will be collecting the new born fry back to the project’s farm for nursing to preferable size for the next seeding to its members and also the extra to be supplied to other farmers this will create consistence and sustainable supply of fingerlings to farmers all the time.</p>

				<h4 class="semi">social and environmental context to the project</h4>
				<p>The project area is Wakyato Sub-county/Nakaseke District which is largely a rural settling with a few urban centers. Fish farming is not new to the district; it has been there since 1954 after the establishment of Kajjansi aquaculture center in Uganda. Fish farming was done at a subsistence level without good technology and poor knowledge. The district is endowed with wetlands, spring wells, loamy clay soils, potential for water harvest for production and domestic use. There is also a high and well established culture for eating fish. All the above are good for aquaculture, horticultural crops and livestock farming. The project will utilize such land for fish farming without degrading as well as encouraging and training farmer how they can benefit from wetlands and conservation of the environment.</p>

			<h3 class="head">potential to general social and economical impact</h3>
			<p>The project will bring together communities with a possibility of forming associations/groups hence creation of fore for strengthening themselves, expression of their interests and aspirations which will intertwine the project into the social-economical fabric of the society. Integration of fish farming will translate into increased production per unit area of land and diversification of farm produces hence poverty reduction.</p>

			<P>The project will expose the members to participatory process of managing profitable and enterprises of mixed farming.</P>

		<h4 class="semi">potential sustainability</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><h5 class="headpartn">financial sustainability</h5><br>Fish products are highly rated as food in Nakaseke District and Uganda at large there is a well established culture for eating fish regardless of sizes.  
			Establishment of fish farming project in Nabisojo minor lake with good market, fish factory and local market will provide finance for the project sustainability.<br>
			The sale of table size fish, brood stock, fries and fingerings to farmers will provide finance and a mechanism for promotion on a sustainable basis.</li><br>

				<li><h5 class="headpartn">social sustainability</h5><br/>The project will build the beneficiaries’ capacity to work as a team and farmers associations/groups for increasing and promotion of fish farm production and productivity. Formation of commercial fish farmers association will create an avenue for labor, information sharing thus attracting assistance and access to credit from financial institution.</li><br>

					<li><h5 class="headpartn">environmental sustainability</h5><br>Semi extensive fish farming will provide mechanism for utilization of water log areas for fish farming instead of being breeding grounds for mosquitoes which cause the deadly malaria to the community. Promotion of fish farming will improve recycling of waste materials to become an input in one sub system leading to increased production per unit area of land e.g. a small fish will be used to make animal feeds and peelings from vegetables will be used for feeding fish.</li><br>

				<li><h5 class="headpartn">institutional sustainability</h5><br>The project will create strong farmers groups which will merge as legal entities. Linkages will be established between fish farmer, buyers, training and research institutions. This partnership will enable farmers to directly benefit from research information and government programs.</li><br>

			<li><h5 class="headpartn">technical sustainability</h5><br>The project have technical staffs who are well knowledgeable with fish farming/breeding technologies, experienced group facilitators and building farmers’ capacity will make the project to be sustainable. With the establishment of hatchery for clerias (cat fish) propagation and Tilapia for stocking the minor lakes, producing fingerlings of semi-natural environment, installation of cages in the lake and construction of ponds around the lake shore will increase production and productivity.</li><br>

		<h3 class="head">the project's strategy</h3>
		<p>The company foremost strategy is to increase fish production into the fish industry by doing so the project  will use all methods possible to achieve its goals this is after stocking the lake it have enabled the company to achieve its first target to raise fingerings in big number  raised in semi-natural way of breeding.<br>
		Now the second phase will be to use to produce fingerlings  to stock ponds which will  be constructed around the lake shores and installing cages in the dippy areas identified in some parts in the lake.</p>

			<p>The company will be able to produce good number of tones of farmed fish into the market. Fish in the free range will be for producing fingerlings of 50-80 grams and table size fish of 500 grams–1kgs.</p>

			<p>Ponds will be used to produce cat fish:</p>

				<p>The company is targeting to produce Cat fish of the body weight of 1kg the company will dig ponds of 20m by 50m to be stocked with 10000 fingerling to be harvested in eight month. Targeting to stock one pond every month for the next 8 months the projected 10tons per cycle.</p>

			<p>Cages will be installed in the lake; this is where the company is to put much effort to raise fish consistently into the market on monthly basis this will be by installing  4 cages every five month of which each cage will be of stocking capacity of 2000fingerlings to harvest 1000kgs per cycle/cage being that the fingering  will be provided by its self we will be caging a size of 100grms and above this will shorten the period of harvesting the company is targeting to produce 4tons of fish with average weight 500gms-600grms Cage size 1.5x2.5x2.5 to be stocked with 2000 Tilapia fingering.</p>

		<p>The period from day one of caging to harvest is estimated six month depends on the buyer’s demanded size.<br/>
		Each cycle is estimated to cost <strong>Shs. 18.400.000</strong> (Eighteen million four hundred thousand shillings.) with estimated production of 4 tons of fish per month, grand sales @ 6.500.000 x 4 tones=26.000.000(Twenty sixty million shillings)</p>

	<h4 class="semi">out growers with community ponds</h4>         
	<p>The company is targeting 100 households as pilot project in the country.<br>
	Farmers will be supplied with fingerling by the project as per stocking cycle at an average number of two ponds per household farmer with stocking capacity of 5000fingerlings of tilapia for the two ponds each so we are targeting two cycles from each farmer because they will be stocked with 50-80grams fingerlings and the harvest body weight will be 350grm-400grms at shortened period five month respectively.</p>

<p>A farmer with two ponds of 2500 fingerlings each the cycle will cost him 6.000.000(six million shillings) for feeds of 3000kgs.
Fingerlings will cost him @ 500/= 2.500.000/= grand sales /harvest @ 400 grams in five months sale @ 6.500.000 x 2 tones=13.000.000(thirteen million shillings) minus over head costs of 2.000.000/ the farmer will have to earn 2.500.000/ from one cycle for five month. 
At this point we expect the farmer be harvesting the fish at 400 grams body weight.<br>
From this sector each house hold is estimated to be earning a gross profit of <strong>Shs. 4.500.000</strong> (Four million five hundred thousand shillings). Well as the Company is estimating to be earning <strong>Shs 250.000.000</strong> (Two hundred fifty millions) from selling fingerlings to farmers in one cycle.</p>

<!--The Project Proposed Plan-->
<div class="plan">
<h3 id="plan" class="head">the project proposed plan <strong>june 2012-2013</strong></h3>
	<p>At this stage the project’s proposed plan is as follows;</p>

		<ol class="planlist">
			<li>To prepare for the rapid multiplication of the tilapia and catfish.</li>
			<li>To maintain the steady growth of the stock.</li>
			<li>Pellet feeds.</li>
			<li>Transport of the project.</li>
			<li>Landing site.</li>
			<li>Fish nets.</li>
			<li>Pens and Cages.</li>
		</ol>

			<h4 class="semi">To prepare for the rapid multiplication of the tilapia and catfish</h4>
			<p>Expansion of the water volume at this stage will be one of the major issues to deal with for the expected new breed.
			 The water volume and surface has to be big enough to accommodate the new born fish.<br>
			 The project is targeting to expand the water volume from 1748280 cubic meters to 6993120 cubic Meters by applying the same system to clear for more extra water surface.
			The water volume 6993120 cubic meters will enable the project rear 1398624000 full grown fish.</p>

				<h4 class="semi">To maintain the steady growth of the stock</h4>
				<p>This will be to monitor the growth of the stock by sampling the stock monthly and also using technicians from the fisheries institutions.<br>
				To fertilizing the new expanded Lake Bank by using organic matters such as cow and chicken wastes plus agricultural garbage.</p>

			<h4 class="semi">Pellets feeds</h4>
			<p>The fish is being feed on pellet feeds bought from Ugachick which is costing the project too much which is at 1550 to 2500/ per acres, we propose that if we could get our own pelletize machine it could make us save 30% from the commercial complete pellet feeds.<br>
			The Pelletize machine is at Shs. 12 000 000/= and the advantage with it is that it’s a diesel driven machine.
			Pellet feeds needed for the nixed six will be 120 bags of 30kgs each of 35% protein content of size 2mm this will be for the newly born fingering which is 3600kgs at 76 000/= per bag for  starter and growers .<br>
			And 240 bags of 30kgs each bag of 25% protein content of size 5mm which is 7200kgs at 46 500/= per bag for grow out and brood stock this will cost the project 20 280 000/= (twenty million two hundred eighty thousand shillings).<br>
			In the process of feeding the fish, during the research it have been proved that tilapia do eat greens leaves like of cassava, potato, cabbage and whatever chicken could eat, as of now the project is getting the greens from the community around the project.</p>

		<p>Here  the project have started encouraging the community to start growing  cassava and potato for both leaves harvesting for the project as well as getting food for their consumption. At this point the management is encouraging the community to grow bigger gardens so as to be able to sell more leaves to the project and also to create food security for their consumption, the project is helping the community by opening land for them and also supplying them with stems and potato leaves for planting, the sector is named leave trade.<br>
		The project has identified cassava and potato spices with more leaves from NARO. 
		Provided leaves are collected in plenty from the project’s sambas and the community’s this will save the project 30% of pellet feeds needed for the project.</p>


	<h4 class="semi">Transport of the project</h4>
	<p>The project will need a 3 tonnage truck to able the collection of leaves and other feeds supplements and materials.<br>
	In case the project has acquired its own Pelletize machine, the truck is estimated at 50 000 000/= (Fifty million shillings). After December the project will need to acquire another truck for transporting fish for marketing.<br>
	Trucks will be of 3 tones Refry body built estimated at 150 000 000/= (One hundred fifty million)</p>

<h4 class="semi">Landing site</h4>
<p>By December the project will begin constructing the standard landing site to handle harvested fish for marketing with better sanitary standards, this is estimated at a cost of 70 000 000/= (Seventy million shilling).</p>

		<img src="photo/landingsite.JPG" class="img-rounded" id="pageimg">
		<div class="captabout"><p>Scene of the current landing site of the project</p></div>
	</div>
	

    <h4 class="semi">Fish nets</h4>
   	<p>The project will need to buy 100 pieces of fish nets which will be used for catching both tilapia and cat fish.<br>
   	Types of nets will be of 6x6 of 9ply, the harvesting equipments required will be 100 pieces of fishing nets of 6 inches mash ply 9 each at 28 000/=  estimated at 10 000 000/= ( Ten million).</p>

 		<h4 class="semi">Pens and Cages</h4>
		<p>The project at this stage pens and cages will be installed in phases, the project is aiming to install 400 cages of 2x2x2 by size, targeting to rear One million fish which will be always reared to the harvesting weight of minimum average of 500 grams the estimate to produce 500 tones annually. Pens will also erected on the shores of the lake where the water is abet not so deep with the depth of 4 feet and will need to lay pens of 15x30 meters the ratio for stocking will be 160 fish per cubic meter which will make each pen to accommodate 72000 fish of 500 grams.</p>

		<p>The project aims to install 24 pens around the lake shores this will make the project to produce 756 tones annually. All the required fingerings to stock the cages and pens will obtained from project’s brood stock.<br>
		By the month of November 2012 the project is planing to start installing cage within the lake, the number of cages to start with will be 50 Cages of 2x2x2 meters of each to accommodate 2500 tilapia.</p>

	<!--impact to wards the community-->
	<h3 class="markethead">expected impact to wards the community</h3>
	<p>This program will bring impact to those who will be part of the scheme to each house hold to be able to earn 4912500 per Cycle, due to the supplied size of fingerlings of 50-80 grams the farmer can run two cycles in a year.</p>

<p>The company will supply the farmers with the fingerlings on credit and provide them with technical assistance and follow up to harvest and marketing the product.</p>

<p>The farmer will need feeds for the fish which we think NAADS and the company will work hand in hand to train them for the self processed feeds and also we shall request the concerned to help the project to get its own pelletize machine so that feeds can be pelletized to reduce water pond pollution by feeding powder feeds.</p>

	<p>Farmers will be encouraged to grow grains to supply the pelletize machine and feeds will be distributed through appointed group leaders to easy the process.</p>

	<p>The first and foremost from our study on the farm fish of the body weight from 60 grams it can feed on feeds with less protein concentrate and grow but the farmer have to take time to reach the desired body weight to harvest but cannot fail to benefit from a cycle.</p>

		<p>Here the president’s appeal for each household to earn at least Twenty million shillings a house hold per year hope it could have been achieved by the participant in this program.<br>
		Our team visited some farmers the findings were promising they still have passions in fish farming despite of the lack of assistance.</p>

				<!--project's conclusion-->
				<h3 class="markethead">project's conclusion</h3>
				<p>All along that janouny since 2009 upto now the project is proud of its current position of which have lead it to be able to produce its own breed thus crossing the farmed breed with the one from the wild natural waters  from Lake Kyoga and Lake Victoria AND after all that process the spieces produced ramains domesticted which will enable farmers for easy rarering to the harvestable size.</p>

			<h4 class="semi">challenges</h4>
			<p>The project is facing a problem of space for the newly born  fish for the room to grow which need more expansion of the area which need to aquire AMPHIBIAN MACHINE which we have identified from Neatherland to enable remove those big  sugs  which can not be managed with the lake mower this machine can be found by surfing <a href="http://www.mobarn.nl/" target="_blank">http://www.mobarn.nl</a> (MOBOTRAC MB-5070 DUOBLE JOYSTICK) to cost the company <strong>Euros 89.734.00</strong> (eighty nine thousand seven hundred thrity four euroes) proforma invoice on page ….<br/>
			Construction of ponds around the lake shores to handle caught fingerling from the lake to tame them for the priod of atlest one month before passing them to farmers for grow out, farmers will be supplied with fingerlings of 50grm-80rm fo which will enable a farmer to run two cycles in a year.</p>

		<p>And the most important found during the research the size of such fingerling can feed on any type of feed including green and self made feed made by farmer as the extension worker have been training them.
		Finally if we are to increase the fish production in our country people need to use some other resources like the one of Nabisijjo and many more have been identified during the research and some mentioned above and farmers.</p>

	<h5 class="semi">findings and benefits from the research</h5>
	<p>The fish Government and all stake holders in the fish industry should change the sytem of supplying 0.05 grm -1grm to farmers of which are too problematic to them to raise as they are so volunalable to predators and water qualities and technical handling.<br>
 	A fingerling of 50 grams-80 grams can feed on any feeds provided ot it the only pricausion the farmer have to put into consideration is on the size of grains it should in powder form thats all and the next one month they can begin feeding them with yam, potatoes cassava leaves etc.</p>

	<p>The company is thereof seeking the government and stakeholders in the fish industry to introduce this concept of research findings to those who will need it or to apply. We think this will need the known extension workers and trainers in the industry to acquire the found method to pass it to farmers.</p>

<h4 class="lasthead">preference</h4>
<p>The major task is to change knowledge and approach towards modern aquaculture but doing research applying hands on experiment with assistance from technical personals of which will be passed to farmers by simple methods, cheap and available resources within the surroundings of the people intending to culture fish for both domestic consumption and commercial benefits
The system we have applied is a Simple method and will enable the project for sustainable supply of grown fingerling to farmers training them and the project is able produce its own breed to increase a consistency farmed fish production in the market.</p>
